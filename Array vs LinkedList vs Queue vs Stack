   Array vs LinkedList vs Stack vs Queue

   Array -
 > We use it to access the middle index value of the Array in O(1) by indexx
 > In order to access the elements in 2d rows and columns (matrix)
 
   Linked List -
 > Insertion of element at beginning & middle takes O(1)
 > It takes the required space to store its elements 
 > Data is accessed sequentially
 
   Stack -
 > Data strcuture is in (Last in First Out) approach
 > Elements added at rear and deleted from rear (O(1)) using linked list & Array
 > you need to implement a Depth First Search
 > Example - A plie of books on top of each other
 
  Queue -
 > Data Structure is in (First in First Out Approach)
 > Example - Bank Queue
 > you need to implement a Breadth First Search
